    'Elliot for Water is a mission-driven enterprise created by Andrea Demichelis to give access to water to millions of people and show that everyone has the power within to make the difference and, more importantly, be the difference.\n\nThe name Elliot for Water is an homage to the Greek God, Helios. He was the god of Sun and Life, and he personified the creative power behind them. \nThis is what Elliot for Water means: energy and life! We want to show that each and every one of us has the power to change the world for the better, even with a simple click. Through Elliot for Water, you can use that same power to change the lives of millions around the world. \n\nRight now, we are working on our first goal to provide water to 1 million people by 2025!\n',

          'This project has been realized in collaboration with WellFound in Ndambe, a small community of 341 people located in the Oio region, about 60km away from Bissau the capital of Guinea-Bissau. \n\nBefore our arrival, the community used to get water from an open-air well.\nWomen, to collect water, had to wake up very early in the morning in order to arrive at the well before others as, very quickly, a long queue would form. In addition to the well, a Market Garden has been implemented.\n\nThe access to water, Market Garden, and latrines facilities have improved the lives of women, children, and men in this community. Kids can now go to school while men and women can work and take care of their families.\n\nMoreover, women are able to sell the left-over of the vegetables produced and pay school fees, buy new clothes, and other food.',
